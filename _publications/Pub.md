<p> In transportation systems, there is an inherent vulnerability due to various physical disturbances and disruptions, such as extreme weather events and unpredictable incidents. Meanwhile, the integration of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and the emergence of Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) have introduced a new dimension of vulnerability to the cyber level. Advanced technologies have undeniably enhanced the system’s safety and efficiency, yet they also introduce the possibility of cybersecurity vulnerabilities, which might have serious and unpredictable consequences for system operation. </p>

<p>Therefore, understanding and enhancing cyber-physical resilience is crucial to assessing the potential impact of these disturbances, maintaining system performance at an acceptable level amid challenges, and sustaining safe, efficient mobility and economic stability. A summary of my work is provided below.</p>
