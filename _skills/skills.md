Hobby
======


* <div style="text-align: justify"> I love climbing 🧗‍♂️ - from bouldering 🪨, to top-rope, lead climbing, and outdoor adventures 🏞️ in my free time.</div>

* <div style="text-align: justify"> I also love hitting the golf course 🏌️‍♂️ and driving range with my friends - still a beginner, scoring above 100, but having a blast every swing of the way! ⛳</div>

* <div style="text-align: justify"> I immerse myself in the soulful vibes of R&B 🎶 and the smooth sounds of Jazz music 🎷 - the ideal companions for my moments of study and relaxation.</div>
