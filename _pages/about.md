Vision
======
<div style="text-align: justify"> 

<p> Inspired by Stephen Hawking's principle that <i>"One of the basic rules of the universe is that nothing is perfect,"</i> we need to embrace imperfection to innovate and improve through engineering, constantly seeking better, adaptable, and sustainable solutions.</p>
<p> As a transportation researcher, my vision emphasizes first gaining a deep understanding of the fundamentals of transportation systems, which then guides the thoughtful integration of advanced technology. This approach aims to improve <b>safety</b>, <b>stability</b>, <b>efficiency</b>, <b>equity</b>, <b>intellgence</b>, <b>resilience</b>, and <b>sustainability</b> of our transportation system.</p>
