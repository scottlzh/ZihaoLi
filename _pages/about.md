Vision
======
<div style="text-align: justify"> 

<p> Inspired by Stephen Hawking's principle that <i>"One of the basic rules of the universe is that nothing is perfect,"</i> we need to embrace imperfection to innovate and improve through engineering, constantly seeking better, adaptable, and sustainable solutions.</p>
<p>My vision is to advance <b>knowledge-grounded</b> and <b>AI-infused</b> transportation systems that integrate <b>cyber</b>, <b>physical</b>, and <b>human</b> dimensions to enhance <b>safety</b>, <b>stability</b>, <b>intelligence</b>, and <b>resilience</b> in future mobility networks.
